## What is Data Analytics?
Data Analytics is the process of:
- Collecting data from various sources
- Cleaning data by removing errors and inconsistencies
- Analyzing data to identify patterns and relationships
- Converting data into meaningful insights

These insights help organizations:
- Make better decisions
- Reduce risks
- Improve performance
- Increase profits

Data Analytics helps businesses understand *what is happening* and *what should be done next*.

---

## Why is Data Analytics Important?
Every organization generates large volumes of data such as:
- Sales data
- Customer data
- Marketing data
- Finance data
- Operations data

Without analytics:
- Data remains unused
- Decisions are based on assumptions

With analytics:
- Decisions become data-driven
- Problems are identified early
- Opportunities are discovered

### Key Importance of Data Analytics:
- Better decision-making
- Identifying business problems and gaps
- Improving customer experience
- Tracking performance and growth
- Supporting future planning
- Reducing manual effort and errors

> Data is valuable only when it is analyzed.

## Data Analytics in Real Life
Data Analytics is widely used to answer real-world business questions:

- *E-commerce:* Why did sales drop last month?
- *Marketing:* Which campaign generated the highest return?
- *HR:* Why are employees leaving?
- *Banking:* Which customers are likely to stop using services?
- *Healthcare:* Which treatment is most effective?

All these insights are derived using Data Analytics.

## Understanding Data and Databases

### What is Data?
Data is a collection of information.

*Examples:*
- Name
- Age
- Address
- Phone number
- Email address
- Username and password
- Images and documents

---

### What is a Database?
A database is a collection of data stored in an organized way.  
Technically, it is a place where data is stored and managed.

#### Types of Storage:
- *Physical Storage:* Books, notebooks, paper records, photographs
- *Digital Storage:* Text files, Word files, Excel files, and databases stored on computers or the internet

---

## Types of Digital Databases
1. *DBMS (Database Management System)*  
   Stores data in files.

2. *RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)*  
   Stores data in tables with rows and columns and maintains relationships.

## DBMS vs RDBMS

| Feature | DBMS | RDBMS |
|------|------|------|
| Data Storage | Files | Tables |
| Relationships | No relationships | Relationships exist |
| System Complexity | Simple | More complex |
| Data Access | Slower | Faster |
| Data Security | Basic | Strong |
| Structure | Simple | Structured |
| Backup & Recovery | Easy | Comparatively complex |
| Data Manipulation | Simple | Advanced |
| Cost | Usually cheaper | Can be expensive |
| Data Size | Suitable for small data | Handles large data well |
| Application Area | Small-scale applications | Enterprise-level applications |
| Examples | Text files, Excel, XML, JSON | MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL |

## Introduction to SQL

### What is SQL?
SQL stands for *Structured Query Language*.  
It is used to communicate with relational databases.

Using SQL, we can:
- Create data
- Read data
- Update data
- Delete data

---

### History of SQL
- In 1970, *Edgar F. Codd* introduced the relational database model.
- SQL was originally called *SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language)*.
- Developed at IBM’s San Jose Research Laboratory.
- SQL became an ANSI standard in 1986 and an ISO standard in 1987.
- Oracle was the first company to commercially distribute SQL.

---

## Why Use SQL?
- Manages large amounts of data
- Standard language for relational databases
- Widely used across industries and applications

---

## What Can You Do with SQL?
Using SQL, you can:
- Fetch data
- Insert new records
- Update existing data
- Delete records
- Create databases and tables
- Modify database structures
- Join data from multiple tables
- Ensure data accuracy and consistency
- Sort and filter data
- Group data
- Backup and restore data

---

## SQL Data Types
A data type defines the type of data that can be stored in a column.

### Common SQL Data Types:

*NUMBER*
- Stores numeric values including decimals
- Used for prices, quantities, and financial data

*INTEGER*
- Stores whole numbers only
- Used for IDs and counts

*VARCHAR*
- Stores text values
- Used for names, addresses, and descriptions

*DATE*
- Stores date and time values
- Used for birth dates, order dates, and timestamps
