# Day 01 – Introduction to Databases & SQL

## What is a Database?
A database is an organized collection of data that allows easy access, management, and updating of information.  
It stores data in a structured format so that large volumes of data can be efficiently retrieved and analyzed.

Example:  
Customer information such as name, email, phone number, and purchase history stored digitally.

## Why is SQL Important?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with databases.

SQL helps to:
- Retrieve data from tables
- Insert new records
- Update existing data
- Delete unwanted data
- Analyze large datasets efficiently

SQL is a core skill for Data Analysts because most business data is stored in databases.

## What is DBMS?
DBMS (Database Management System) is software that allows users to create, manage, and interact with databases.

Functions of DBMS:
- Data storage and organization
- Data security and access control
- Backup and recovery of data

Examples: MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server

## What is RDBMS?
RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) is a type of DBMS where data is stored in tables consisting of rows and columns.

Key features:
- Data stored in tables
- Uses primary keys and foreign keys
- Maintains relationships between tables

Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server

## Difference Between Database, DBMS, and RDBMS

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Database | Collection of stored data |
| DBMS | Software used to manage databases |
| RDBMS | DBMS that uses a relational table structure |

## What is DDL?
DDL (Data Definition Language) is used to define and manage the structure of a database.

Common DDL commands:
- CREATE – Create tables or databases
- ALTER – Modify table structure
- DROP – Delete tables or databases
- TRUNCATE – Remove all records from a table

## Working with Customer Data
Customer data generally includes:
- Customer ID
- Name
- Email
- Phone number
- Purchase history

Using SQL, customer data can be filtered, analyzed, and used for generating insights, reports, and dashboards.
