🚀 Day 12 – Advanced Power BI & Final Project (ETL with Power Query)

Overview

Day 12 focuses on advanced Power BI concepts and working towards final project completion. This session explains how real-world Data Analyst projects are built end-to-end — from raw data to cleaned datasets and final dashboards.


ETL Process in Power BI (Power Query)

ETL stands for:

Extract  
Getting data from multiple sources

Transform  
Cleaning, shaping, and preparing data for analysis

Load  
Loading transformed data into Power BI for reporting

Power Query is the primary ETL tool used in Power BI.


Data Transformation

Data transformation converts raw data into an analysis-ready format.

Common transformations include:
Renaming columns  
Changing data types  
Removing duplicates  
Filtering rows  
Splitting and merging columns  
Replacing incorrect values  

The goal is to improve data quality and reporting accuracy.


Data Cleaning

Data cleaning ensures data is accurate, consistent, and reliable.

Includes:
Handling null or blank values  
Removing duplicate records  
Fixing incorrect data types  
Standardizing text formats  
Removing unnecessary rows and columns  

Clean data results in trustworthy insights.


Merge Queries

Merge queries are used to combine tables horizontally, similar to SQL JOINs.

Key points:
Uses a common key between tables  
Supports Left, Right, Inner, and Full Outer joins  
Used when related data exists across tables  

Example:
Merging sales data with customer information.


Append Queries

Append queries combine tables vertically.

Key points:
Tables must have similar column structures  
Commonly used to combine monthly or yearly datasets  

Example:
Appending sales data from multiple years.


Custom Columns

Custom columns allow creation of new calculated fields in Power Query.

Used for:
Mathematical calculations  
Conditional logic  
Text transformations  
Date-based calculations  

Example:
Profit = Sales − Cost


Advanced Editor

The Advanced Editor shows the M language code behind Power Query steps.

Why it is important:
View complete transformation logic  
Modify or optimize transformations  
Handle complex ETL scenarios  
Gain full control over data preparation  


Final Project Perspective

By the end of Day 12, you understand:
How raw data is imported  
How data is cleaned and transformed  
How tables are merged and appended  
How final datasets are prepared  
How dashboards are built using clean data  

This reflects real-world Data Analyst workflows.


Key Takeaways

Power Query is the core ETL tool in Power BI  
Clean data is essential for accurate dashboards  
Merge works like SQL JOIN  
Append works like SQL UNION
